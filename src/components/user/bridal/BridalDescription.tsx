There are absolutely light-weighted, stunning, designer and quirky dresses that can steal the show as the bride walks down the aisle. Beauty of ‘less is more’, edginess, style and modernism is brought to the fore with an exquisite bridal wear collection of BANARASI. Spotlighting the changing face of trends, BANARASI offers a few key fashion pieces from its ocean of designer wedding wear.</p>
